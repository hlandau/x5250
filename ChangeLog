Version 0.5.4:

2011-01-31 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix special characters for German.

Version 0.5.3:

2010-05-20 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Add system request key to pop up dialog.

2010-04-16 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Add support for geometry setting.
	- When using scalable fonts, size the font to fit the geometry setting.

2010-02-08 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Add support for scalable fonts.

Version 0.5.2:

2010-01-27 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix erase_caret() to fully erase the caret with large fonts.
	- Fix erase problem with destructive backspace.

2006-01-09 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix the event loop to check for all event types.  This should fix
	  problems with x5250 getting out of sync as well as getting stuck
	  in an infinite loop.

2006-01-06 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix uninitialized file descriptor when checking events.

2006-01-05 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Change configure to not require tn5250.pc.
	- Fix crash caused by dragging the mouse outside the x5250 window
	  in 132 column mode.

2006-01-04 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix window widths.

2005-11-14 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Change the key buffer used by keyhandler() to use unsigned char.
	  This fixes issues with keysyms whose 8-bit representation starts
	  with a 1 (anything with a keysym definition of 0x80 or higher).
	- Remove ugly kludge for entering the cent symbol.  With the above
	  fix it isn't needed anymore.
	- Fix crash caused by out of bounds error when selecting text with
	  the mouse and dragging the pointer beyond the bottom of the window.

2005-11-11 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Change draw_caret() to check that row and column arguments are
	  sane.

2005-05-25 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Check key handler to return the integer value of the keysym to
	  lib5250 if we don't know what the key is.  Hopefully lib5250 will.

Version 0.5.1:

2005-05-25 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Add checks for Sun keysysms to configure.ac.
	- Ignore state of caps lock key when checking maps.

2005-05-12 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Add initial support for key mapping.

Version 0.5.0:

2005-05-06 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix uninitialized return value that cause abnormal exit.
	- Fix selection beyond edge of window bug.

2005-05-04 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Change the X event loop to try to squash the 80->132 column screen
	  redraw bug.

2005-05-02 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix performance problem introduced by the forced screen refresh
	  mentioned below.  lib5250 now tells us when to draw a character
	  on the screen which eliminates the need for the forced refresh.
	  Added x5250_terminal_putkey() to handle lib5250's new callback.
	- Fix subwindow resize problem when changing from 80 column to 132
	  column.

2005-05-01 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix typeahead by forcing a screen refresh.  This isn't the way I
	  want to solve this, but it works.  The end result is that the
	  screen is redrawn much more than it needs to be and therefore
	  x5250 runs slower and is less effecient.
	- Fix problem with screen not drawing after a resize event.

2005-04-09 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Eliminate subwindow array and use linked list in lib5250 instead.

2005-04-09 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fix menubar draws.
	- Change menu item handling.

2005-04-05 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Begin support for 5250 menus.

2005-04-04 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Removed old word wrap code.

Version 0.4.8:

2005-04-02 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Forced redraw when entering text in a word wrap field.
	- Removed extra debugging info from resource.c.

Version 0.4.7:

2005-03-25 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Finally fixed the last of the window drawing problems.

2005-03-24 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Don't realloc or free windows unless we really need to.

2004-12-17 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Handle XK_ISO_Lock through XK_ISO_Last_Group_Lock.  This was
	  causing a 'key not handled' message to print when entering
	  characters such as the euro or cent.

2004-12-06 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Added --debug-resources to show debugging information on the X
	  resource database.

2004-12-06 Scott Klement <tn5250@scottklement.com>
	- Fix for Sun keyboards F11 and F12.

2004-12-02 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Changed configure.ac to automatically check for macro support in
	  lib5250.

Version 0.4.6:

2004-12-01 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed up the debug menu.
	- Removed the call to XClearWindow() when changing screen sizes.
	- Check for all types of events to kickstart the event loop to
	  prevent events from getting "stuck".  This still seems like the
	  wrong solution.
	- Fixed bug that left unerased artifacts on the screen when using
	  5250 windows in enhanced mode.

2004-11-30 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Added a debug menu.
	- Added a "dump screen buffer" button to the debug menu.
	- Moved the "toggle attributes" button from the main menu to the
	  debug menu.
	- Fixed a bug in destroy_screen() that resulted in the screen
	  contents not actually being erased.  This should fix the remaining
	  problems with prior screen artifacts hanging around.
	- Hopefully fixed problems with pasting not occurring until some
	  other event happens.  So far so good for me, but Martin Rowe is
	  having this problem much more than I am.  For me it has so far
	  worked every time.  Let's see what Martin reports.

2004-11-29 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Finally removed the last call to XClearWindow().  Let's see what
	  problems we have now...

Version 0.4.5:

2004-11-26 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed crash that was occuring when new windows did not cover the
	  location of the cursor of a previous window.

2004-11-15 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Changed the screenfields buffer to be dynamically allocated.
	- Changed the screen content buffer to be dynamically allocated.
	- Changed the window buffer to be dynamically allocated.

2004-11-04 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Added a toggle button for column separators.
	- Added a toggle button to display attributes.

Version 0.4.4:

2004-11-01 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed the out of sync key problem.  x5250_terminal_waitevent()
	  now calls XCheckMaskEvent() to see if there are any pending
	  key events (and puts them back in the event queue if there are).
	  For some reason the select() statement doesn't detect key events
	  that are waiting to be processed.  So we just force the issue.

2004-10-29 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed the last of the screen redraw problems (I hope!).

2004-10-26 Scott Klement <tn5250@scottklement.com>
	- Fixed application defaults database search path.

2004-10-26 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed missing #include "config.h" that was preventing
	  getopt_long() from being compiled on platforms that support it.
	- Removed extra VERSION definition from x5250.h and just use
	  PACKAGE_VERSION in config.h.

Version 0.4.3:

2004-10-25 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed problem with caret not being erased when an AID key is
	  pressed.
	- Restructed build directories for better use with autoconf.
	- Changed autoconf system to install X5250 in --datadir.
	- Changed merge_db_X() to look for resources in DATADIR.

2004-10-22 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed artifacts resulting from entering characters in blank areas
	  of the screen that remained blank on the next screen redraw.

Version 0.4.2:

2004-10-22 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Wow, has it really been that long?  Fix configure.ac to check for
	  getopt.h (thanks to Scott Klement for showing me how).
	- Fix up x5250.c to use these checks in a sane (and hopefully
	  functional) way.
	- Use getopt() instead of getopt_long() if we can't find getopt.h
	  since getopt() appears to exist on all platforms.
	- Remove conditional compilation of locale functions since it
	  appears that all platforms use them the same way.
	- Change the help text to not show long options if getopt.h doesn't
	  exist.
	- Remove XClearWindow() in favor of XClearArea that clears just the
	  places we need to.  This fixes the annoying flickering problem.
	
2004-08-19 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Cleanup icon a bit (ha ha!  Punny!).

Version 0.4.1:

	- Fixed problem with popup menu popping under the main windows and
	  other windows.
	- Fixed undisplayable character bug.
	- Partially fixed "trailing attribute" bug.  We still need to update
	  the attributes when the 5250 attribute character is overwritten.

2004-06-24 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Added support for using dots as column separators.
	- Added a user resource for dot column separators.
	- Updated the help text to show separator style option.
	- Added new column separator resources to the X5250 resource file.
	- Added K_ERASE, K_REFRESH, K_MEMO, K_TESTREQ, and K_EXEC keys.
	- Added cleanup code that runs when the main loop exits.
	- Tested macro feature to verify it works.  Compile with
	  -DMACRO_SUPPORT to enable.
	- Changed main window hints to allow the window manager to place
	  the window.
	- Changed popup menu to be a top level window like a popup should be.

2004-06-23 Frank Richter <frichter@esda.com>
	- Partial support for German keyboards.

2004-06-23 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>

	  the bug report Martin!

Version 0.1.8:

2004-06-22 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Improved handling of extended 5250 window attributes.  This still
	  requires a patch for tn5250 to work.

2004-06-21 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Added missing tracefile support.
	- Added current column/row to bottom right of window.

2004-06-20 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>

	  sees the splash screen).
	- Added the font resources to the X5250 resource file.
	- Changed the menu text to say "Ctrl" instead of "Cntrl".
	- Fix problem with entire window being selected when left mouse button
	  is pressed on the popup menu.

	  did not have focus.
	- Fixed backspace key.
	- Added a user resource for bell volume.

2004-06-17 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Added Control-q to quit keyboard short cut.
	- Put shortcut key labels on menu.

2004-06-16 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>

	- Started initial work on the extended (or enhanced) 5250 protocol.
	  Added support to x5250 to handle the create window structured field
	  5250 command.  Patched session.c (part of tn5250) to instruct the
	  remote host to use the extended 5250 protocol.  In order to compile
	  x5250 to use this code, you must use -DENHANCED when compiling x5250
	  and put "+enhanced" in your .tn5250rc file.

2004-06-14 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed screen update problem after insert key was pressed.

2004-06-13 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Made text selections be highlighted.

2004-06-11 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed the insert key.
	- Fixed the delete key.
	- Moved the reset key onto the right-click menu (Cntrl-R still works
	  as well).
	- Shift+middle click now left aligns pasted text.

2004-06-10 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Made text paste work.  It would be nice to have an ability to choose
	  newline handling method:  left align, simple newline, or ignore
	  newline characters.

	  (unless overridden by the -title option).

Version 0.1.3:

2004-06-08 James Rich <james@eaerich.com>
	- Fixed foreground and background color allocation.

2004-06-07 Scott Klement <klemscot@klements.com>
	- Added autoconf/automake support to x5250 project.
