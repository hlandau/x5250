This is the README for x5250.  x5250 is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.  Please see the file COPYING for complete details.


Requirements:
1. x5250 uses lib5250.so from the tn5250 project.  You can download tn5250
from http://tn5250.sourceforge.net.  Any release will work, but you will
get the best results with current cvs or release 0.17.2 or later.

2. X11 Window System.  This part is probably already installed on your
machine :)


Installation:
1. extract the tarball (which you must have done already) using:
	tar -xvzf x5250-<version>.tar.gz
or:
	gunzip x5250-<version>.tar.gz
	tar -xvf x5250-<version>.tar

where <version> is the version number you downloaded.

2. Change into the x5250-<version> directory and type:
	./configure

3. And finally:
	make

Everything should build with a few warnings.  You can install x5250
using:

	make install

If autoconf doesn't work for you the Imake method is still available.  Just
copy the Imakefile from the attic/ directory and edit it appropriately.
Then do 'xmkmf' followed by 'make'.  There is no 'make install' using the
Imake method, but at least it will compile.

To see a (partial) list of what remains to be done look at the file TODO.

If you are interested in developing x5250 or if you want to understand it's
design, please see the file DESIGN.  It would be a good idea to take a look
at the file GOALS as well.

If you have any questions/comments/flames/suggestions please email them to
