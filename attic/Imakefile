# The CDEBUGFLAGS line probably needs to be changed.  Almost certainly
# it is not the correct place for -I includes, but for now it will work.
# You should change the -I include to match the output of either
# 'glib-config --cflags' or 'pkg-config --cflags glib' depending on how
# recent your glib is.  On my Slackware system both work fine.
#
# Make sure that lib5250.so is in one of the locations specified in
# /etc/ld.so.conf or the linker won't work.
