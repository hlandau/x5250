1. Change cursor color when in reverse image fields (or use a completely
   different color for the cursor).
2. Complete i18n support.
3. Change attributes of a field when a 5250 attribute character is
   overwritten.
4. Add 'screen debug mode' which shows 5250 attributes and pops up a
   window when clicked showing what attributes are active.
5. Fix bug involving the debug menu not popping down when deactivating the
   main menu.




Milestones

Below are listed those requirements and features that must be met before a
certain release (or milestone) is made.  This list exists in order to get a
better idea of where this is all headed.  This does not indicate what order
requirements will be met or features added, but rather states that by
milestone x.y.z the listed requirements and features will be met.

0.5:

  * x5250 will fully implement all of the features already present in xt5250.

1.0:

  * Top level X windows or dialogs for 5250 "windows".
  * Cursor progression support.
  * Continuous field support.
  * Word wrap field support.
  * Copy/paste support.
  * Key remapping.  This would normally be thought of as part of the 0.5
    milestone, but it really belongs here.  That is because tn5250 doesn't
    really have key remapping per se, it just uses mechanisms that already
    exist outside of tn5250.  x5250 will use the standard X mechanisms for key
    remapping (just as xt5250 does) but unlike xt5250 will make the mappings
    by calling XRefreshKeyboardMapping() and related functions in addition to
    reading the map from the default files.
  * "Busy" mouse cursor.
  * All customizable aspects listed in DESIGN complete.
